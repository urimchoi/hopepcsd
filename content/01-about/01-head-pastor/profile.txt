Bio: As a middle-schooler growing up in Baltimore, Pastor Joe dreamed of becoming a pastor because he loved being with the church family so much.  He loves worshipping, fellowshipping, and sharing life with brothers and sisters in Christ.  While in medical school in Grenada, one of the things he missed most was preaching the Word every Lord’s Day!  He realized then how much he loves preaching the Word.  Our church is committed to gospel-centered preaching.  Pastor Joe also loves the city of San Diego.  He roots for all things San Diego.  He prays for its shalom.  He is grateful to God for allowing him to preach the gospel to the people he loves in this beautiful city.
