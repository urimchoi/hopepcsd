Title: About

Text: My design philosophy is to keep things simple and clean while paying impeccable attention to each and every detail. During my time as a designer at the CIA, I learned that just a few yet meticulously refined design elements is a powerful combination to effectively convey my clients' stories. I love to integrate subtle but compelling imagery, typography, and illustration in my work making sure to pay equal attention to beauty and performance.

Antoine de Saint-Exupery eloquently describes my continuous mission to improve this design process: "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."

When I'm not designing, you will most likely find me bouldering with my husband, obsessively documenting my daily adventures through Instagram, biking in Brooklyn, and collecting old and new stamps, postcards, and maps.
