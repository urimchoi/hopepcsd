Blurb: To be a member of a church is to make a public promise to live according to the Word and to support the work of the congregation. In the Bible this is called a covenant. Every believer is part of the church when we think about it as an organism (the Spiritual Body of Christ), but only by a public promise can someone be part of the church as an organization. A public promise, or covenant, is the basis for all society according to the Bible: marriage, employment, citizenship and church membership are all relationships of accountability.
