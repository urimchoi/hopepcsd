Title: Sermon 5

----

Synopsis: Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing for me here now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and be a Jedi, like my father before me. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.
