Title: Sermon 6

----

Synopsis: What!? Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.
